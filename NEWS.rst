Version 0.10.0 (In development)
===============================

New features
------------

* #22849: Updated SAML implementation, with support for signed requests,
  single sign-on and single logout.
* #22381: Replace 'Enhedsnummer' with a description of the location of the organisational unit.
* #23558: Added the possibility to create managers without employees through the ou endpoint, thus allowing for vacant manager positions.
* #22849: Added handling for user permissions, giving a fitting error if a user attempts an action without the correct permissions.

Internal changes
----------------

* #23559: REST API now uses and enforces ISO 8601 dates in all cases
  except history display. All ``from`` or ``to`` dates must either
  lack a timestamp or correspond to midnight, Central European time.
* #23559: The ``terminate`` endpoints for employees as well as units
  now read the date from the ``to`` field rather than ``from``.

Bug fixes
---------

* #24067: Fixed being able to edit root organisational units
* #23559: Display end dates *inclusively*, so that the year ends 31
  December rather than 1 January.
